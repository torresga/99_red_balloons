This is the readme for 99 red balloons. It is a game written with the Gosu
development library http://www.libgosu.org . 

A lot of the code is a mish mash of the Gosu tutorial.

All the images I took from Google Images. Oops.

DONE

# * 1. Create new window with apocalypse background
# * 2. Get balloons to show up on the screen randomly
# * 3. Get Zeppelin on the screen - zeppelin needs to be smaller and ends need to be transparent
# * 4. Get Zeppelin to move around
# change functionality of keys.. key up moves zeppelin up, key down moves zeppelin down, key right moves zeppelin right, key left moves zeppelin left 
# * 7. Put timer in top middle corner of screen.
# * 6. Put balloon counter in top middle of screen. Every time you catch a balloon, the counter increases.

TODO

# * Animation... balloon disappears? then a new balloon is created?
# * when player crashes into balloon, balloon disappears
# 5. Get balloons to randomly disappear in 10 seconds
# I want zeppelin to be drawn over the balloons.
# 8. After sixty seconds, if player has not caught 99 balloons, they lost. If player caught 99 balloons they win.
# 9. Play 99 red balloons.

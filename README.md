I made this game using the Gosu development library: http://www.libgosu.org .

The object of the game is to collect 99 balloons in 60 seconds. 

The code is a mish mash of the Gosu tutorial and pure experimentation. It is playable- it just needs to be refined. 

All the images I used I took from Google Images. Oops. Sorry for any unfair use :)

TODO

- Balloons need to disappear after 10 seconds if they are not caught.
- I want the zeppelin to be drawn over the balloons. I have no idea how to do that.
- After 60 seconds, if player has not caught 99 balloons, they lose. 
- If player catches 99 balloons they win. Any balloons they catch after they win should not reflect in the counter.
- After player wins or 60 seconds pass, game functionality should stop.
- Play 99 red balloons. Because Nena is awesome.

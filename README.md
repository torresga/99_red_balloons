I made this game using the Gosu development library: http://www.libgosu.org .

The object of the game is to collect 99 balloons in 60 seconds. 

The code is a mish mash of the Gosu tutorial and pure experimentation. It is playable- it just needs to be refined. 

All the images I used I took from Google Images. Oops. Sorry for any unfair use :)

TODO

- Balloons need to disappear after 10 seconds if they are not caught.

I think in order to do this I need to make an animation. Like, actually change the image so there are two states. That should be the easiest way to make it look like they move.

- Play a clip of 99 red balloons.
 
- flip the counters. instead of 1, start from 60.

- make the text different colors, make it more centered.
